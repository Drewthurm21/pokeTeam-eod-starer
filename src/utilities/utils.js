/*

  JavaScript practice:
    fetch api or Axios
    async / await
    JSON

  We need a way to fetch pokemon data.
    create a function that fetches a pokemon by id and returns the data
      - the base url for the pokemon API is https://pokeapi.co/ (docs linked in README)     
    export the function so that it can be used anywhere in our application
